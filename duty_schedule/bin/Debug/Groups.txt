# PeopleAndGroups.txt
# This is the file that contains all the groups and their members along with which days off they want.
# Note that any line that begins with '#' is taken as a comment, but it won't understand in-line comments.
#
# Groups explained:
# 	Each line that doesn't begin with whitespace is a group name. 
# 	One person from each group will be scheduled for every duty day on the schedule.
# 	Anyone with the same name in multiple groups will be assigned to both groups.
# 	
# 		Groups in this example: Senior RA, Inside Rounds, and Outside Rounds
# 	
# People explained: 
# 	People should be listed after the group name that they belong to.
# 	If any individual wants to request a day off, add '-' after their name followed by the date.
# 	If you have multiple people with the same name, make sure you include a last initial/name to differentiate (see Matt A. and Matt B.)
#
# Other notes: 
# 	Dates can be in different formats for your convenience
#	If you list one person in multiple groups, they will be scheduled for both groups (see Ashley vs. Matt A. and Matt B.)
# 		If you list requested days off for someone in multiple groups, the program will append those days to their list of days off (see Ashley)
#	Any requested days off will be honored unless every person in that group has the same day listed
# 	If you need multiple shifts per night for the same position, just make two groups with the same people
