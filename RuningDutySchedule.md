# Introduction #

This is a basic step-by-step how-to on creating a calendar for your staff.

If you get an error on startup, make sure you have at least [v4.5 of the .NET Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653) and the latest version of [Microsoft Office](https://office.microsoft.com).

# Footnotes #
Please note that this is a pet project that I did in my free time. I guarantee nothing and am not responsible for any issues, mishaps, or booboos somehow caused by this application. By downloading, you agree to these terms.

This application uses Microsoft .NET C# and Microsoft Office tools. I am clearly not Microsoft and am simply using the tools they provide.

This has been tested on Windows 8.1 with Office 2013 including a Gmail address as the primary Outlook account because that is what is available to me. Again, I guarantee nothing.
